# Portfolio Website #
### By: Brandon Wenaas ###
- I used a template from HTML5 UP as the basis for this site, all of which is contained within the folder in this repository.
- The file index.html serves as the front page for the site, visually presenting the pages that branch off of it.
- Each page is named single_[PAGENAME].html. This convention is intended to distinguish beween individual posts/pages, and (potential) extra index pages. Though as there are only 4 posts/pages currently, a single index page is sufficient.
